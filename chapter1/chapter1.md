# 1. Introduction



## 1.1. Course goals



The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to current computational techniques to students in the biological sciences. By the end of this course students will gain proficiency in UNIX and Python.



## 1.2. Computational background



Computational devices are ubiquitous in modern day society. From the actual computers we use, to the phones in our pockets, our cars, microwaves, and even the automatic doors at grocery stores, computers have found themselves injected into every aspect of our lives. This is especially true in the sciences where software "has consumed the world."



Despite this, computational literacy in society at large and even in the sciences are at alarmingly low rates. Further yet, particularly in the biological sciences, computational literacy remains constrained to use of graphical interfaces in programs such as Excel, with little attention given to command-line tools and computer programming. In the age of Big Data, point and click tools are largely insufficient for proper analysis, and command line tools are the only viable option. This course will ideally  provide a frame work for students in the biological sciences to learn how to leverage command line tools and computer programming to approach current problems in the age of Big Data.





## 1.3. Device setup



This course ideally works best in a computer lab setting where all students have access to the same types of computers. However, there are numerous other options available to be able to follow these course materials.



###  Linux setup



If you have access to a machine that runs some sort of distribution of Linux \( i.e. Ubuntu, Fedora, Cinnamon, Manjaro, Debian\) setup will be a breeze for you! Most of the tools needed for this course are likely installed by default on your system. If you are using raspberry pi, please use the following guide on proper setup of that system.



1. Terminal

	* all Linux systems have a terminal installed

	* this will be used extensively throughout this

	* follow these steps to find how to launch terminal in your distribution



2. Bash

	* This is the tool we will be using to teach UNIX basics, as long as you have the following Linux distributions , this will be the default. For other distributions please see the following guide.

3. Python

	* should be installed by default on Linux distributions

	* can be accessed through Terminal

	* follow this guide to check python installation on your Linux systems



### Mac setup



If you have acess to a Mac computer, you should also have most of the tools needed for this course installed by default.



1. Terminal

	* all Mac systems have a terminal installed

	* this will be used extensively throughout this

	* follow these steps to find how to launch terminal in Mac



2. Bash

	* This is the tool we will be using to teach UNIX basics, this will be the default on Mac.



3. Python

	* should be installed by default on Mac

	* can be accessed through Terminal

	* follow this guide to check python installation on your Mac



### Windows setup



1. Run

2. Run fast

3. Run far



### Chromebook setup



1. Run

2. Run fast

3. Run far



## 1.4. Text editor setup



The text editor we will be using for this class will be atom, refer to the folloing guides depending on your device to install this program.





## 1.5. Everything is a text file



Provides information about the UNIX system in reference to text files as well as how to make a text file in atom.



## 1.6. Host your text files on github





Provides information on how to setup github account, how to get files to and from github page on computer using terminal and atom.
